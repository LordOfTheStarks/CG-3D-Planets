setup tutorial:

- Open bash
- git clone https://github.com/LordOfTheStarks/CG-3D-Planets.git
- After cloning, the file is usually located in C:\Users\USER\CG-3D-Planets
- After locating the file create an empty file called 'bin' inside the CG-3D-Planets folder (C:\Users\USER\CG-3D-Planets\bin)
- Open CMAKE select 'C:/Users/USER/CG-3D-Planets/All-Planets' as source code and 'C:/Users/USER/CG-3D-Planets/bin' for building the binaries
- After generation open project and right click to set playground as startup project
